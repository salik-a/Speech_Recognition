# Speech_Recognition
-This code wrote for my Senior Design Project. You can read Senior Design Project Report.pdf document for full project.

-This code takes 4 seconds voice for finding 5 commands that 'Jarvis', 'Turn on the television', 'Turn on the ligths', 'Turn of the lights','Tell the air temperature'. Then take MFCC of this voice and use dynamic time warping algorithm to compare with recorded voices and find the closest command.
